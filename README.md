# automatic-colorization
Wanna turn your gray images to color? Well this is a machine learning project
that works on a solution for that!

To use the ppimage module, give one or many tar files as inputs, then the last
argument is a folder to output the changed tar files.

Inspired by [this website](http://tinyclouds.org/colorize/)

We downloaded a 1.2 terabyte file full of images from [here](http://www.image-net.org/download-images)
