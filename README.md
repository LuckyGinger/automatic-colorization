# automatic-colorization
## Introduction
Wanna turn your gray images to color? Well this is a machine learning project
that works on a solution for that!

Inspired by [this website](http://tinyclouds.org/colorize/).

We downloaded a 1.2 terabyte file full of images from [here](http://www.image-net.org/download-images).

Edit and run the ./colorize file with some images to colorize them.
